## Guinea Pig Extravaganza

This simple shiny app lets you understand much more of the effect of Vitamin C on the tooth growth in Guinea Pigs. Using the ToothGrowth data set, we let use choose a subset of the guinea pigs (those who got Vitamin C and those who received the other supplement). So, it's so simple, we plot tooth length and dosage for you.
